# Tell Governor Kemp: Shut down Georgia TODAY, Save Lives #shutdownGA

We call on the Governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, to order an immediate shelter-in-place.

Specifically, just as Governor Gavin Newsom has declared for [40 million people in California](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/),

- **People must be ordered to stay home except for essential needs.**
- Vulnerable populations **must** stay home.
- Everyone is required stay home except to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or go to an essential job.
- Going outside for walks is allowed, but keep at least 6 feet distance.

Bars, nightclubs, dine-in restaurants, gyms, all must be closed. We cannot hesitate. Italy has shown us what happens if we do not take decisive and severe action.

[From Italy](https://www.change.org/p/scientific-community-open-letter-to-the-scientific-community?): "The beginning of the outbreak had the exact same number of infections in China, Italy, and other countries. The difference is that China strongly and quickly locked down Wuhan and all of the Hubei region 8 days before Italy. **Just 8 days of delay for the Italy lockdown will result in an enormous increase in the number of total deaths in Italy with respect to China."**

We can see the [trajectory in Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Italy), a nation of 60 million people:

- Feb 25:  322 confirmed cases and 10 deaths.
- **March 1st**: 1694 cases and 34 deaths total.
- **March 9th, Shut down**. 9172 cases and 400 deaths total.
- **On March 19**, 475 people died in a *single* day (3k deaths, 35.7k cases total). The effects of the lockdown will not show up for a few days yet.

Georgia has 10 million people, not 60 million.

- March 19: We have 287 cases, and 10 deaths total, but we have 1/6 the population, so we are at the equivalent of (287*6 ~= 1700) cases. **We are at Italy's "March 1st", we cannot wait to be Italy's "March 9th"!**

Yesterday, Italy surpassed China in number of deaths. **We cannot wait another week to shut down, we must do so now!**

China [shutdown]（https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/timeline-china-coronavirus-spread-200126061554884.html） a population of 56 million people (in 16 cities) with less than 1300 known cases. **In the epidemic trajectory, that is where Georgia is now!** After locking down, Wuhan built a [1600 bed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishenshan_Hospital) hospital in 10 days, and still was overrun. But they were able to draw on resources from surrounding regions that had shut down earlier in their own trajectories.

The path of the pandemic is clear: it is coming, and millions of people and our economy will suffer. **But if we act now instead of in a week, we will save thousands of lives**.

**[Listen to doctors](https://midnightmass.substack.com/p/50-medical-docs-warn-of-massachusetts), stop [worrying](https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/kemp-rejects-statewide-shutdown-brace-for-coronavirus-scrambles-for-health-supplies/0pYYAFVOkyV4VIhLkEJajK/) about government overreach, and start worrying about residents. *Urging* people to do things is not strong leadership.** No employer is going to feel *urged* to close down, and vulnerable populations are still going to work. Humans are social by nature and won't feel *urged* to not see friends. **Shutting down must be a state-wide requirement.**

The economic fallout will be huge: business will fail, people will lose their jobs. But waiting will only make it worse. We need to learn from the thousands of deaths in China and Italy. **We are not somehow different from them and above the force of nature.**

I am proud to be a Georgian. **But let Georgia be a leader, not a follower. Let us #shutdownGA and work together to overcome this pandemic.**

**Governor Kemp, please order an immediate shelter-in-place order for Georgia.**
